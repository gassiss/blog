THen every paragraph becomes a p

adding space creates a new element
what happens if I don't put a blank line between
so if I don't put blank line
they all stack together as one big line

but with extra lines

And this is how [a link](http://localhost:8000) looks like.

> see here a blockquote  
> THIS IS A bloCKQUOte

its a new p element

```javascript
// Inside code quotes becomes pre tag
function something() {
  console.log("hit");
  return 2 + 2;
}
```

`javascript>console.log('inside backticks become code tag')`

`text>this is none backticks`

THen every paragraph becomes a p

adding space creates a new element
what happens if I don't put a blank line between
so if I don't put blank line
they all stack together as one big line

but with extra lines

its a new p element

```
Inside code quotes becomes pre tag
function something() {
    console.log('blablabla')
}
```

`inside backticks becomes code tag`

# introduction

# why comunication is important

-> how sales and communication are linked
-> sales is more important than product
--> person context
---> resume/cover letter
---> receiving promotion
---> selling your idea in the company
---> leading your team
--> business context
---> business doesn't exist without sales
---> impact on reputation

# specifically, why writing is crucial

in the contexts above explain why focus on writing over speaking

-> speaking starts with writing
-> more leverage as it hits more people
-> words speak for you when you're not actively speaking

# in the context of software development

-> As software developers, we're constantly reading docs, not watching docs.
-> Don't buy into the "good code documents itself" BS:
--> No one writes good code all the time (and most people don't write "good code" at all)
--> It's harder to read code than to write it
--> We read more code than we write
--> If code is properly documented in english where it's due, code reuse is easier
-> Onboarding peers into your team is easier if everything is documented in writing
-> You probably want to write specification for your features
--> these should, ideally, be maintained in source control like you do with source code/tests
--> they should evolve as the feature progresses

# conclusion

In a world with 280 character messages and 60 second elevator pitches, it's hard to argue against the importance of communication as a skill.

I know a grant total of 0 people who would say communication is **not** an important skill. If you do your math, I bet you will land at the very same total that I have.

Which makes sense. In a world of tweeting and stuffed email boxes, being able to communicate precisely what you want in a clear and concise manner is **crucial**, and surprisingly hard. And although most people know this, very few people actually go out of their way to improve their communication skills.

I'm guilty of this, too.

That's one of my main drivers for this blog, actually.

Even though I have a very good vocabulary, I am not the best I could be when explaining my ideas with words. So by creating this blog and making it a routine to write regularly, I hope to bridge this gap.

## Why you should start writing

Writing is a skill like any other. Take, for example, playing guitar.

Can you improve by watching other people play? Of course.

Is that enough to become a great guitar player? **Hell no!**

That definitely helps. But to become good at playing guitar you have to, above all else, practice. To become a good writer you have to write.

And the more you do, the better you'll get. So if you want to become a good writer, you should just start writing. Just do it. Even if you don't publish it, that's ok.

## The benefits

Before going into the benefits, I want to show the image below about **Learning Curves** followed by the explanation - both extracted from [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve)

![Image of the learning curve graph](./learning-curve-graph.png)

> A learning curve is a graphical representation of how an increase in learning (measured on the vertical axis) comes from greater experience (the horizontal axis); or how the more someone (or something) performs a task, the better they get at it

This graph shows that you improve **a lot** faster at any given skill the less you know about it. Body builders even have a dedicated term for it - **noob gains**.

But let's go back to the guitar example from before. If you never touched a guitar in your life, you'll think that someone that spent a reasonable amount of time practicing it, let's say 200 hours, a lot better than they actually are. You might not be able to tell the difference between someone with 200 hours of practice and 1000 hours of practice - or even at a pro level, depending on the complexity of the song.

Now when you see someone with 10 hours of practice, you can definitely tell this person just started learning. That's because this person is not too far ahead of you. _The farther the person is at a given skill, the harder it is for you to gauge how good that person actually is_ in relation to other people.

As I say this, you might claim:

### But every one writes, all the time. Texting, email, tweeting... The list is endless!

But almost anyone is actually going out of their way to actually **improve** their writing. That consists of, to name a few examples:

- Spotting grammar mistakes on your own writing;
- Making a concious effort to write properly - without spelling mistakes and with correct punctuation;
- Review what you wrote before submitting it;
- Asking for feedback for other people about your writing.

So this means that you don't need to write several books to become good at writing. You just need to practice and make a concious effort to improve it for a little bit, and you will be way ahead of the majority of people out there.

This is great for several reasons, which I'll talk about in another post.

In the meantime, start writing!

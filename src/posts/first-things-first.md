The recent years enabled a boom in communication media. Nowadays, we are constantly engaged in some form of communication - social media posts, tweets, pictures, videos, emails... The list is endless.

I personally love it, but I am guilty of always being in the consumer end. I barely ever give any contribution outside of a "thumbs up", and one of my main goals of this blog is to change this.

## Why you should have a blog too

The reasons why I think **you** should have a blog are the same reasons why I am starting one. The end goal is to, ultimately, become more efficient **communicating through text**.

This may not apply to you, if:

- You're a professional who doesn't need to communicate much by text;
- You're already capped in your writing skills; or,
- You don't care.

No doubts there are still people who fit in the first bullet, but if you're one of them it means I am making a terrible job advertising this blog. If you _think_ you fit in the second bullet, you're definitely wrong. There are plenty of well-regarded writers who still see themselves as a work in progress.

The third bullet is undebatable. Not caring is the best excuse there is for doing (or not) anything.

## Reason #1: Practice makes perfect

I'm a software developer, and as such, I spend most of my day reading what other people wrote. But I also spend a good portion of my day writing stuff that other people will read in the future (including myself).

Writing is a skill like any other. You get better at writing by writing a lot. So if you, like me, need to communicate a lot through text, this is a good enough reason to start writing yourself.

## Reason #2: Spreading your ideas

I personally love to help other people. I'll be writing software related posts for the most part to give other people my perspective on any give subject.

Hopefully I succeed, and you learn something from me. I'm reaping the benefits of writing about anything (including this) right away, so it's a win-win situation :)

## Reason #3: Maybe you're wrong

This relates to the previous reason. We often have the idea that any person writing about something on the internet is right.

This is specially more intense if you don't know much about the given subject.

I don't expect to be always right and I hope you speak up about my mistakes. I could be wrong, or I could be right. If I'm right, I can tell you why I think so and convince you. If I'm wrong, I learn something new and become better at the given subject. Win-win.

## That's it

If you decide to start your own blog, let me know! I'm frequently running out of stuff to read about and I'd love to help you improve this skill too! :)
